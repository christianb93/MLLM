        "As we would expect from an encoder-decoder architecture, T5 is mainly a sequence-to-sequence or text-to-text model, i.e. its input is a sequence of token, and its output is a different sequence of token which, in general, does not have the same length as the input. In the training method used for T5, the input and labels for different tasks are all converted into pairs of sentences, so that the same model can be applied to a large variety of tasks. The firsts part of the sentence is fed into the encoder, the second part - the labels - are fed as targets into the decoder which is then trained using teacher-forcing on these labels.\n",

This reflects the training method that was used for unsupervised pretraining that is called **span corruption**. With this method, the model receives an input in which spans of words are replaced by a special token. The model is then trained to predict the value of these masked spans."

The model is given two sentences, where the first one is a premise and the second one is a hypothesis. The task is to predict whether the hypothesis follows from the premise (\"entailment\"), is contradicting the premise (\"contradiction\") or neither nor applies (\"neutral\"). Again, the task is specified by using a task specific prefix, namely \"mnli\", followed by \"premise\", followed by the premise, and then \"hypothesis\" before finally the hypothesis is added to the input.

Two years after T5 was published, Google published a [follow-up paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416) in which the team presented FLAN-T5, a version of T5 that, in addition, has been trained on a large number of open questions like in our example.
